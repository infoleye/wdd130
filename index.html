        <p>Abuja, Nigeria's capital, has a history rooted in both ancient tribal lands and modern urban planning.
            Originally part of the Hausa kingdom of Zazzau, the area was inhabited by various tribes, including the
            Gbagyi and Koro. In the early 1800s, King Abubakar founded the kingdom of Abuja, which became a commercial
            center. Later, the British occupied the area in 1902 and reorganized it into an emirate. The modern city of
            Abuja was built in the 1980s and officially became the capital on December 12, 1991, replacing Lagos.</p>
